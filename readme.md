# Tiny Contour Util

Herein are a couple  of tiny bash scripts that I use on my `Contour HD VHoldR` helmet camera when plugged in to OSX machines.

* `move` creates a subfolder of the current user's Pictures folder and moves all video files from the camera's memory card into that folder.
* `clean` asks for confirmation, and if given permanently removes all video files from the camera's memory card.
